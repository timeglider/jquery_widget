The first iteration of JS, created over a 10 day period, was a super-flexible, but also highly flawed child of the internet age.",

It was first formulated by Alonzo Church as a way to formalize mathematics through the notion of functions, in contrast to the field of set theory. Although not very successful in that respect, the lambda calculus found early successes in the area of computability theory, such as a negative answer to Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem.",
